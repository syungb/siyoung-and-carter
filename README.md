# Siyoung and Carter wedding website
## Intro
This is my first website built in clojurescript using reagent. The website was built in Dec 2019 for my wedding which was originally planned in 2020, then the event has been postponed to 2021 due to covid 19. This website is something I've built all by myself, and has been pleasure with updating and maintaining it.

## How to run
Make sure node, yarn and clojure are installed, then in terminal run:

```
yarn dev
```
then visit, http://localhost:3000
